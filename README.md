Early Stroke Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on early stroke detection from brain CT images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist medical professionals by providing accurate and fast stroke classification.

Project Description

A hybrid deep learning approach is used by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for classification. Grad-CAM is used to visualize stroke-affected regions in CT images.
